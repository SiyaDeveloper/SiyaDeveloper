### 🔥 What I Do

I craft **scalable full-stack applications** with a focus on performance, UX, and clean architecture. From **React & TypeScript** frontends to **.NET Core & Rust** backends, I bridge the gap between design and infrastructure — all while keeping it **cloud-native** and **developer-friendly**.

Currently obsessed with:
- 🧩 Gamifying user experiences
- ☁️ Building on AWS (Lambda, S3, API Gateway)
- ⚙️ Systems programming in **Rust**
- 🌐 The future of **GraphQL & Web3**
